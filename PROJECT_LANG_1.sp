.ez P For: seanpm2001/Learn-SCRIPT
.ez P About:
.ez P I decided to make SCRIPT the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-SCRIPT) as SCRIPT is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the SCRIPT programming language. It only makes sense to SCRIPT the official language for this project. It is getting its own, project language file, starting here.
